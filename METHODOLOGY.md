# 🧮 Financial Methodology

## 1. The Problem Statement
Real estate capital raising is notoriously expensive (high underwriting fees) and illiquid (hard to sell). Tokenization promises to solve this, but "Gas Fees" and "KYC Costs" often eat the margins. This model calculates exactly **when** tokenization becomes profitable.

## 2. Benchmark Assumptions (2025 Market Rates)

### A. Traditional IPO (The Baseline)
Based on standard listing requirements for the Victoria Falls Stock Exchange (VFEX) or ZSE:
* **Underwriting Fees:** 4.0% of Capital Raise.
* **Legal & Advisory (Tier 1):** Fixed cost of ~$120,000.
* **Marketing & Roadshow:** ~$30,000 (Physical events).
* **Exchange Fees:** 0.05% of value.

### B. Security Token Offering (The Innovation)
* **Smart Contract Audit:** Fixed cost ~$25,000.
* **Regulatory Sandbox (SECZIM):** Est. ~$60,000 application & legal wrapper.
* **Platform Success Fee:** 2.0% (Lower than underwriting).
* **Digital Marketing:** ~$10,000.

## 3. The "KYC Killer" Variable
The model introduces a dynamic variable often ignored in crypto: **Identity Verification Costs**.
* **Assumption:** It costs ~$1.50 to verify a user (ID scan/liveness check).
* **Impact:**
    * Raising $5M from **$50 investors** requires 100,000 people -> **$150,000 in KYC costs.** (Unviable).
    * Raising $5M from **$5,000 investors** requires 1,000 people -> **$1,500 in KYC costs.** (Highly Efficient).

## 4. The Verdict
The model solves for the **Efficiency Frontier**, recommending a minimum token price of **$5,000** to maximize savings ($157,500) while remaining accessible to "High Net Worth" retail investors.
